            <h2>Introduction</h2>
             <hr>
            <p class="lead"> In a society where individuals are constantly connected through their phone, radio, computer, TV, the door to the outside world has never been more wide open. People have constant instantaneous access to events 
            taking place in their own town, as well as events thousands of miles away. This access to information is achieved through social medias like Twitter or Facebook, as well as through the medias. As such, they can choose how the 
            information will be relayed to the world. They can also select which events will be transmitted to the readers and watchers, whether they are real or not, giving them the power to influence the vision people get of their environment.
            Take the example of the 2016 presidential campaign, where fake news that Clinton approved weapons sales to Islamic jihadists  shifted the preference of voters toward Trump rather than Clinton. 
            </p>

            <p class="lead"> 
            In our project, we intended to evaluate the way media influence our perception of the world. We used the GDELT database, which monitors the news media around the globe in more than 100 languages from a growing number of broadcast,
            print, online sources. Every 15 minutes, it records all mentions of events in the news, as well as the characteristics of the events, such as the type of event, the country and time it took place and the Goldstein score, which is 
            the theoretical impact the event could have on the country.  For each mention, they record the time the mention entered the database, as well as the type of source (web, broadcastâ€¦.) and the source of the document. The mentions we
            have access to were recorded between February 18th 2015 and September 9th 2017.

            <h2>Data Exploration</h2>
             <hr>
            <p class="lead"> We first explored the dataset, to see what we would have to deal with. Because mentions can refer to events which happened minutes ago as well as to events which happened months ago, some events referred to in the mentions 
            took place before the beginning of the recording. Their first mentions were thus not recorded in the database. Likewise, the events taking place at the end of the recording had less chance to be mentioned. In order to give each event the 
            same weight in terms of related mentions, only the events taking place after February 18th 2015 and before July 9th 2017 were retained.  
            </p>
            <p class="lead">We found out that most of the sources were web sources and that offline sources were only slightly represented. This makes sense since web sources are spreading in a world where everyone has unlimited instantaneous access 
            to information on the internet but needs to pay for a newspaper. Besides, the database can easily access the news published on the web, as they are available worldwide, whereas they would need to be in the country where a newspaper is published 
            to get it. To support this, the web portal yahoo.com was the first ranked source with more than 18 millions mentions, whereas the second sources only had 1.8 millions. This is coherent with the fact that yahoo was rated the most widely read news 
            and media website in 2016 by the web traffic analysis company Alexa. On top of that, we found that although most sources had their headquarters in the United States,  there were still sources from other countries as the UK, Australia, India .

            <p class="lead">We then looked at the confidence of each mention. This value represents the estimation of the confidence at which an event is extracted from a news report. The confidence is higher for news report which focus on an event, whereas 
            it is lower for mentions which only briefly describe the event. Half of the mentions were recorded with less than 50% confidence and one third of the mentions were recorded with less than 20% confidence. Most events thus required hard work from 
            the algorithm to detect them, rendering the accuracy of the extraction less confident.  Since our analysis focused on the number of mentions per event and since the database contained millions of mentions, the mentions with less than 20% confidence 
            were removed, in order to keep only the reports which seriously mentioned the events.

            <h2>Human Activity and Mediatic Coverage</h2>
             <hr>
            <p class="lead"> As our analysis focused on the events reported by the news in different countries, we represented for each month in each country the human activity relayed by the news and the media coverage of these events. The media coverage represents 
            the number of mentions related to each event in the 2 months following the first recording of the event, and gives an insight to the importance given to the event. Indeed, if an event receives more mentions, we would expect that it is of great importance. 
            In order to give an even better insight at the value given to an event on the mediatic scene, we wanted to evaluate the mediatic attention of an event, that is the number of mentions related to an event during a certain period, with respect to the total 
            number of mentions during the same period.
            </p>
            <div>
              <a href="https://plot.ly/~bizeul1/9/?share_key=XIoUxnFWshKdtLiW8MNEb5" target="_blank" title="Plot 9" style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img src="https://plot.ly/~bizeul1/9.png?share_key=XIoUxnFWshKdtLiW8MNEb5" alt="Plot 9" style="max-width: 100%;width: 600px;"  width="600" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /></a>

            <p class="lead">However, since we observed that the total number of mentions worldwide was stable throughout the months, we decided to keep the mediatic attention as a measurement of the value given to an event. The human activity, on the other hand, represents 
            the events mentioned in the news. In this way, it does not portray all events taking place in the country, but only what is relayed by the media. However, we assume here that it is an accurate representation of what is happening in a country. What jumps to the 
            eyes on these 2 maps is the prevalence of the United States in both human activity and media coverage. Even though they are the 3rd biggest country in terms of surface area, they have no particular reasons to be that prominent in the news. This indicates an important 
            bias in our dataset, as most of the recorded events took place in the USA. This can be related to the fact that most of the sources considered by the database have their head office in the USA.

            <p class="lead"> We then evaluated the relationship between the news related to an event and the Goldstein scale of the event, which as written above, is the theoretical impact the event could have on the country. A lower score indicates more potential for the event 
            to destabilize a country, whereas a higher score indicates a trend for the event to lead to the countryâ€™s stabilization. We wanted to observe whether the Goldstein score of an event was proportional to the number of mentions it received, to see whether the media would 
            give more weight to the destabilizing events than the positive ones. We observed that the average number of mentions per event for each Goldstein score was more or less constant. Thus, there did not seem to be any relationship between the Goldstein score and the media coverage.

            <br>
            <p class="lead"> This lack of relationship was also displayed when selecting 5000 events and representing for each of them their mediatic coverage and Goldstein score. In order to confirm this, Pearson and Spearman coefficients were evaluated on 70â€™000 events, to have a reliable 
            estimation with enough samples. Pearson coefficient indicates whether there is any linear relationship between the two variables, whereas Spearman indicates whether there is any monotonic relationship. Both methods returned values close to 0, suggesting the absence of any relationship 
            between the two variables. This indicated that an increase in the potential of an event to stabilize the related country did not lead to an increase in media coverage, or the opposite.

             <hr>
              
            <p class="lead"> To go deeper in the analysis of the influence of the characteristics of an event on the mediatic attention it receives, and find out whether the countries are discriminated in term of mediatic attention, we focused on 4 countries. The selected countries were the USA 
            because they are highly prominent in the media and are really active in terms of human activity according to the news, Syria as it has been a country at war since the Arab Spring protests and is thus expected to be unstable and present in the media, Pakistan  as it has been the target 
            of terrorist attacks in the recent years and would be expected to be a main subject in the news, and Australia as it is an occidental country in the South hemisphere. For each of these countries, the number of events as well as the average media coverage per event were represented t
            hroughout the months. Also represented were the numbers of what we considered violent and peaceful events. Violent events were assault, fight and mass violence whereas peaceful events were public statement, appeal and expression of intent to cooperate.

            <br>
            <p class="lead">For all countries, there were more peaceful than violent events and the evolution of peaceful events was similar to the evolution of the media coverage throughout the months. The proportion between violent and peaceful events was higher in Syria, in accordance with the
             conflict which has been taking place there for years. As observed on the map, an exceedance of events and media coverage was displayed by the USA, due to the bias of the database which mostly considered american sources. The Goldstein scores  were lower for Syria and Pakistan, which 
             was consistent with the instability of these countries. What was also interesting was that even though Pakistan and Syria had similar global activity as Australia during the 2 years, they received less mediatic attention. The fact that the database considered more australian than 
             pakistani and syrian news sources might be responsible for this, similar to the USA. This might also display that even though Australia is in the South, it is more represented in the news than less developed countries. Whatâ€™s more, a downward peak of the Goldstein was usually associated 
             with a peak in violent events as well as in media coverage. Thus, even though no linear or monotonic relationships were observed between the Goldstein and the media coverage, a more negative Goldstein indicated more media coverage.

            <iframe width="900" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~bizeul1/17.embed"></iframe>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">The average media coverage per pacific or violent event gave a better idea of the mediatic attention given to these extreme events. The difference in media coverage between the different countries confirmed that Pakistan receive less mediatic attention than the other 
            countries. However this comparison between countries is not significant here, as we have seen that the database is biased and does not equally consider the countries. The trend displayed was that violent events received more attention than peaceful event, which would be expected as 
            they disrupt the equilibrium of  the country and thus attract more medias. It also reflected a general behaviour of todayâ€™s society, a society of show where people are attracted by violent disrupting events rather than political events. Open up the 20 minutes in the metro in the morning 
            and you will see that most of the events are daily incidents like crimes, accidentsâ€¦
